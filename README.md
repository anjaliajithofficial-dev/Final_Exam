# Final_Exam
I have received the 4th program
I have created a folder and then initialized the git repository.Then I gave the user name and email and I have cloned this repository in the folder I had created. After cloning I changed my directory to that of the remote repo. Then i have created a C file. Then using a set of git commands I pushed the file to the remote repository.  
I have also added another file. I have used the same exact methods. the commands i have used to add  and push files are:


nano file.c


git add .


git commit -m "Message"


git remote -v


git push -u origin main
